Hi, I’m @peterniebert, I do research and teaching on embedded systems and IoT at Aix-Marseille University.
This github account serves primarily to discuss and submit pull requests to systems like zephyr. I am happy about
any exchange concerning Nordic and Zephyr, in particular in proprietary radio applications.
